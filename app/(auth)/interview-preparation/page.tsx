                           Customer discovery interviews are only valuable if you can remember and act on what you learn. Take detailed notes during each conversation, recording not just what people say, but also their tone, body language, and emotional responses.

                         <p>
                           After each interview, take time to reflect on the key insights and patterns you're noticing. Look for common themes across different conversations and identify the most significant pain points or opportunities.

                           Follow up with participants when appropriate. If someone mentioned a specific problem you're working on, reach out with updates or additional questions. This builds relationships and shows you value their input.

                    When talking to your customers, it can be extremely tempting to pitch your business idea. However, it is important to listen and learn from your customer; not the other way around. People will generally be supportive of your idea. This could be misinterpreted as them con rming that they would pay for your product or service. Being supportive of your idea and being willing to pay for it are two very different things.
